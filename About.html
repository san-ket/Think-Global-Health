              Think Global Health is a multi-contributor website that examines
              the ways in which changes in health are reshaping economies,
              societies, and the everyday lives of people around the globe. The
              articles on this website consider the ways that health influences
              and interacts with broader social, economic, and demographic
              trends, ranging from the global growth of cities and the migration
              of people, to the effects of climate change and worldwide trends
              in agriculture, to the expansion of international supply chains
              and the empowerment of women and girls.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4" style="font-weight: 600; text-align: justify">
              The mission of Think Global Health is to provide a compelling
              forum for examining where and why global health matters and to
              engage readers in the debates and efforts to improve health
              worldwide. To realize this mission, Think Global Health is
              committed to featuring and publishing contributors in low- and
              middle-income countries, and on topics in global health that have
              been neglected in the past. As of June 1, 2022, Think Global
              Health is offering an honorarium to the lead contributor from a
              <a

              >
              to support their participation in the site. In its coverage, this
              website seeks to illuminate the ways in which global health is an
              investment in societies and economies, not just a form of
              humanitarian or emergency relief. If you have questions about the
              honoraria, please reach out to us at

              Magazine, New York Times, Intercept, Washington Post, the BBC, and
              many others.
